He can row out to them but they cannot come ashore to visit him. They hope that this time he will also bring cigarettes.',

The ship’s insurer, Thomas Miller, claimed that as the ship was damaged, it was not seaworthy and therefore not covered by their policy. Left with no escape, the crew spent 8 months aboard the ship, before finally being repatriated. They have still not received their full wages.',

The ship has been stuck to same patch of sea for 3 years now. Skeleton crews come and go, stuck at sea with intermittent food and water.  It’s flagged to Cameroon and locked in an ongoing dispute with Bulgarian port authorities. In 2020 the owner changes the name, and for unknown reasons switches the flag to Israel, another country that hasn’t ratified the Maritime Labor Convention. The crew start to receive threatening phone calls, telling them to stop organising, or they’ll be made unemployable. The insurance company they are using is called East of England P&I, a name chosen to make it sound like they’re one of the big insurance players, West of England or North of England, but it’s a mysterious company with an office in Cyprus that turns out to be uncontactable. Up the coast on the black sea, war rages.'
